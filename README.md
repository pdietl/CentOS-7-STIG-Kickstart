CentOS 7 STIG Kickstart

This is a kickstart with the goal of making CentOS 7 STIG compliant. I have been unable to find a working kickstart so I decided to make my own. This is still a WiP so feel free to improve or change anything.

This will currently perform a hands free install with an OpenScap score of 88%. The only additional packages installed not needed for STIG compliance are ClamAV, Libre-Office, XFCE, and OpenScap â€“Workbench.
